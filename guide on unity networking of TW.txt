video 1

create the sever using console and visual studio 
i put mine in drive d under main and under server 

program.cs in the server
server.cs in the server
client.cs in the server


unity make the project game client
client.cs
uimanager.cs
added text input field and a button

# i ADDED MYSELF TMPRO inputfield inside uimanager.cs

end result: able to display incoming connection on the console in the client able to put in the input field and hit connect nothign happens afetr wards


video 2


packet.cs in the server
serversend.cs in the server

clienthandle.cs in the client
packet.cs in the client
threadmanager.cs in the client

#I added myself framerate.cs 

clientsend.cs in the client

serverhandle.cs in the server
threadmanager.cs in the server
gamelogic.cs in the server

constants.cs in the server

end result: able to send and receive data by using TCP and threads on both client and server


video 3

no new sripts added

end result: only add UPD connection 

video 4


gamemanager.cs in the client
playermanager.cs in the client
playercontroller.cs in the client
camercontroller.cs in the client

create folder for prefab 
create folder for materials

end result: we now instantiate a player and it moves. but still 3d movement and there are 2 camera the main one and the camera spawned with the player. I decided to disable the camera in the spawned player since for now the map is as big as the screen only, the movement is only for pc i will add it at video 5 because the disconnections is still not handeled properly, there is also no jump button yet.

video 5

very short just 1 file each to update in client and server

end result: disconnection, but the disconnected players body is still left in the early platers? will be fixed in future video

video 6

create new unity project for the server 
2 folder for scripts and prefabs

server.cs
serverhandle.cs
serversend.cs
threadmaanger.cs

packet.cs
player.cs
client.cs
constants.cs

networkmanager.cs

all 9 scripts in the server

end result: disconnection works properly?? id didnt do anything just moved the server into unity and for 2d game make the rigid body 2d on both server and client.

### make sure in player settings to enable run in background in both client and server unless it will do nothing if it is not the currently active window.

video 7


end result unity server side collision and i change it so it works on 2d rather than using character controler script in unity i use rigid body and rb.velocity


video 8 

end result: fixed the problem when players disconnecting 

video 9

end result: i didnt do anything

video 10 


end result: i didnt do anything

video 11

end result: fix tcp and udp in portforward connections and other ip


setting up connection

step 1 - 6 is sending from client to server
packet.cs, clientsend.cs on client side
1 - client side call this function ClientSend.SendMessage();
2 - add that function on clientsend script
3 - packet script in clientpackets enum add the function lower case 1st letter

packets.cs, server.cs, serverhandle.cs on server side
4- server.cs in the server add in initializedserverdata() in packethandlers
5 - add the packet 
6 - add function on serverhandle.cs


step 7 -12 server to client
packets.cs, serversend.cs on server side
7 - from anywhere call serversend.function
8 - add the function in serversend.cs then choose if it is send udp or tcp and if all or just the 1 client
9 - add in packet.cs in serverpackets

clienthandle.cs, packet.cs, client.cs
on client side
10 -12 same as 4-6 but on client

note: server hosted in unity play mode wont work if the client is available via lan it must be run as a pc standalone build.

if it is available online you can play in my phone using mobile data and i can play in unity editor in the same device as server but have to be 127.0.0.1 ip on the unity editor or 192.168.1.4 since its my local device as well
